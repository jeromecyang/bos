##Why this name?

```Great is Thy faithfulness! Great is Thy faithfulness!
Morning by morning **new mercies I see**;
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided.
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me!```

(Chorus from *Great Is Thy Faithfulness*, Thomas O. Chisholm, 1923)

My roommate and I hope we will always remember God's new mercies, as we see this app every morning before leaving home.
